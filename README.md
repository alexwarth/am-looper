# Instructions

To start recording a new layer, press SPACE.
To stop recording, press SPACE again.

If you point at a layer,

- hold SHIFT and move mouse left/right: slide layer in time
- hold CONTROL and move mouse up/down: change gain (louder/softter)
- press BACKSPACE: delete the layer
- press M: toggle mute
- press S: toggle solo
- press B: toggle backwards
- press D: duplicate layer (can shift the original and duplicate indpendently)

The blue bar at the right margin is the master volume slider.
Point at it, hold down CONTROL and move mouse up/down to adjust it.

# Ideas

- Modify in/out points for each layer
- Record your performance w/ the gain "slider" (like parameter locks in synths)
- Support for multi-part music (verse, chorus, bridgeâ€¦)

# TODO

- Clean up the mess that I made with `devicePixelRatio`
- Fix bug that's preventing me from using different input devices
- Really think about the UI
