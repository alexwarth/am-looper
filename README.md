# Instructions

To start recording a new layer, press SPACE.
To stop recording, press SPACE again.

If you point at a layer,

- hold down SHIFT and move mouse left/right to slide layer in time
- hold down CONTROL and move mouse up/down to change the layer's gain (louder/softer)
- press BACKSPACE to delete the layer
- press M to toggle mute
- press S to toggle solo
- press B to toggle backwards
- press D to duplicate the layer (can shift the original and duplicate independently)

The blue bar at the right margin is the master volume slider.
Point at it, hold down CONTROL and move mouse up/down to adjust it.

Press LEFT/RIGHT to change the channel you're recording from.
(Multi-channel recording is coming, but this unlocks some stuff I wanted to do in the meantime.)

Press UP/DOWN to adjust the latency offset.
It takes some trial and error to find the right setting for you input device and computer.

# Ideas

- Modify in/out points for each layer
- Record your performance w/ the gain "slider" (like parameter locks in synths)
- Support for multi-part music (verse, chorus, bridgeâ€¦)

# TODO

- Experiment w/ web audio's built-in echo cancellation for no-headphones operation
- Really think about the UI
- Help the user find the right latency offset
- Show new layers as they're being recorded
